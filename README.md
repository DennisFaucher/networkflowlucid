# Why

![Why](https://github.com/DennisFaucher/networkflowlucid/blob/main/images/why.png)

Mapping the network flows between servers, VMs, and applications can be very useful for application dependancy mapping, data center migration, disaster recovery planning, and network congestion. My learning journey took me to for-fee and for-free products including VMware [VRNI](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-network-insight.html), [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), [ntop](https://www.ntop.org/), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/), and [LucidChart](https://lucid.app/). If you have the IT and financial resources, VRNI and Dynatrace are excellent. If you do not, ntop, MariaDB, and LucidChart are a good start.

# How
My test case is my Home Lab. My Home Lab has two VMware ESXi servers (Intel NUC, Raspberry Pi 4) and one Linux laptop. I wanted to collect network flows between VMs and physical hosts to see which apps were using the most network bandwidth. This requires
