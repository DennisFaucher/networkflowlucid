# Why
Mapping the network flows between servers, VMs, and applications can be very useful for application dependancy mapping, data center migration, disaster recovery planning, and network congestion. My learning journey took me to for-fee and for-free products including VMware [VRNI](https://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-network-insight.html), [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/), ntopng, MariaDB, and Grafana. If you have the IT and financial resources, VRNI and Dynatrace are excellent. If you do not, ntopng, MariaDB, and LucidChart are a good start.
